feature_title_2::string::DISTRESSED & SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE SELLERS
feature_text_2::text::If something in your life has motivated you to sell your property in an urgent manner, we can facilitate the purchase of your home or property as it stands, so that you can quickly get paid. Our arrangement leaves out the cost of updates and repairs that sellers often incur. It bypasses the process of listing your property on the MLS, typically a 2 to 4-month process. In this way, foreclosure can be avoided and money can be used for other priorities.
